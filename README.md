If you have a XLSX file with all the localized strings of your project, you can use **threepojs** to parse the XLSX file into a JavaScript object containing all the strings.

# Usage

Since we use object rest/spread, Node **8.3** is required.

threepojs still isn't in **npm**, so in order to use it, you have to be in the project's folder and run:

    $ node index.js ~/path/my_strings.xlsx
