If you have a XLSX file with all the localized strings of your project, you can use **threepojs** to parse the XLSX file into a JavaScript object containing all the strings.

# Usage

threepojs still isn't in **npm**, so in order to use it, you have to be in the project's folder and run:

    $ ./index.js ~/path/my_strings.xlsx

# To do list

Since this project just started, things are still a little rough around the edges. You can check the todo list [here](https://github.com/FrankKair/threepojs/issues).
